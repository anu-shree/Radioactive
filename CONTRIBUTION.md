### NO ONE DIRECTLY PUSHES ON MASTER
* Create a branch from your name
* Mention the issue in your branch name
* Follow the structure specified for easy merges and PRs
* Track your progress using [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) (optional)

## COMMIT FORMAT
PLEASE write good commit messages. A standard format for that would be something like :

<VERB> <action performed> 

The verb is usually present tense only.
No pull request to master if any of the commit messages fail to follow this format.
Feel free to write longer commit messages of up to 70-80 characters (i.e without the use of -m flag).
